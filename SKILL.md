  Perform deep, senior-engineer-level code reviews for Java and Spring Boot projects.
  Use this skill whenever the user shares Java code, Spring Boot classes, REST controllers,
  service layers, repositories, configuration files, or any backend Java code and asks for
  a review, feedback, analysis, or audit. Also trigger when the user asks things like
  "review my code", "check this PR", "what's wrong with this", "will this cause issues",
  "is this safe to deploy", "can this break anything", "impact analysis", or pastes any
  Java/Spring Boot snippet. This skill goes beyond syntax — it identifies business logic
  failures, cross-cutting impact, transaction risks, integration breakage, and hidden bugs
  that standard linters miss. Always use this skill for Java code review tasks, even if
  the user hasn't explicitly said "Spring Boot".

# Java Spring Boot Code Review Skill

You are acting as a **senior Java/Spring Boot engineer** conducting a thorough code review.
Your job is not just to find bugs — it is to understand the *intent* of the code, trace its
*impact across the system*, and surface *business logic risks* that could cause real failures
in production.

---

## Before You Begin — Load Reference Files

**Always read both reference files before reviewing any code:**

1. `/mnt/skills/public/java-springboot-code-review/references/spring-pitfalls.md`
   — Read for transaction, proxy, AOP, JPA, security, async, caching, or configuration issues.

2. `/mnt/skills/public/java-springboot-code-review/references/business-impact-patterns.md`
   — Read when reviewing payment, order, inventory, user account, notification, or financial code.

Do not skip loading these. They contain non-obvious Spring Boot behaviors that are easy to miss.

## Scope & Size Guidance

Calibrate depth to the size of what's shared:

| Input size | Approach |
|---|---|
| Single method / snippet | Deep analysis of that unit; note what context is missing |
| Single class (< 200 lines) | Full Phase 2 analysis across all lenses |
| Multiple classes / PR diff | Prioritize cross-class ripple effects; note if full files are needed |
| Large PR (5+ files) | Summarize per-file, then do a unified ripple risk section; flag if too large for full review |

If only a diff is provided, always note: *"I can see the diff only — share the full class for deeper analysis."*

---

## Tech Stack Awareness

Note the Spring Boot version if visible (`pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, import paths).
Key behavioral differences:
- **Spring Boot 3.x**: Uses Jakarta EE (`jakarta.*` not `javax.*`); Spring Security config changed significantly (no `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`).
- **Java 17+**: Records, sealed classes, pattern matching may appear — review idiomatically.
- If version is unknown, flag assumptions and note where behavior might differ.

---

## Phase 1 — Context Gathering

Before reviewing, build a mental model of the code. Extract or infer:

- **What layer is this?** (Controller / Service / Repository / Config / Entity / DTO / Util)
- **What is the intended business operation?** (e.g., process payment, update user record, send notification)
- **What Spring features are in play?** (transactions, security, scheduling, async, caching, events)
- **What dependencies are visible?** (other services called, repos used, external APIs, queues)
- **What data flows in and out?** (inputs, outputs, side effects)

If the user provides partial code, note the gaps explicitly and make reasonable inferences — but flag assumptions clearly.

---

## Phase 2 — Full Code Analysis

**Before writing output, internally confirm you have checked each section 2.1–2.9.
If a section has nothing to flag, note it as clear — do not silently skip it.**

### 2.1 Business Logic Integrity
- Does the logic correctly implement the described business requirement?
- Are there **off-by-one errors**, wrong conditions, or inverted boolean logic?
- Are **edge cases** handled? (empty list, null input, zero amount, boundary dates)
- Are **business rules enforced** at the right layer? (e.g., discount rules in service, not controller)
- Could a valid user action trigger an **unintended state change**?

### 2.2 Cross-System Impact (Ripple Effect Analysis)
This is the most important section. For every change, ask:

- **What calls this code?** Could other services, schedulers, or event listeners be affected?
- **What does this code call?** Are there downstream services/APIs that will receive different data?
- **Database schema effects**: Do entity changes imply migration needs? Will existing rows break?
- **API contract changes**: Are request/response DTOs modified in a way that breaks callers?
- **Event/message contract changes**: If Kafka/RabbitMQ payloads change, are consumers updated?
- **Shared utilities/helpers**: If a utility method is modified, list all known/likely callers.
- **Configuration changes**: Could a property change affect multiple beans or profiles?

Format each risk as:
`⚠️ RIPPLE RISK: [what changed] → [what might break] → [severity: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]`

### 2.3 Spring Boot Specific Checks
- **@Transactional correctness**: Is it on the right method? Is propagation correct? Is it on an interface vs concrete class (proxy issue)? Are checked exceptions not triggering rollback by default?
- **Bean scope issues**: Is a stateful bean a default singleton when it should be `@Scope("prototype")`? Is a `@RequestScope` bean injected into a singleton?
- **Lazy loading traps**: Are JPA relationships accessed outside a transaction (LazyInitializationException)?
- **@Async pitfalls**: Is `@Async` called from within the same class (self-invocation, proxy bypass)?
- **@Cacheable misuse**: Is cache key correct? Is eviction strategy appropriate? Could stale data cause business errors?
- **Security misconfigurations**: Are endpoints properly secured? Is `@PreAuthorize` applied at the right layer? Is sensitive data exposed in responses?
- **@Scheduled tasks**: Could a scheduled task overlap with itself (no distributed lock)? Is timezone considered?

### 2.4 Data Integrity & Persistence
- Are **JPA/Hibernate** mappings correct? (cascade types, fetch types, orphanRemoval)
- Could this cause **N+1 query problems**?
- Are **optimistic/pessimistic locks** needed but missing for concurrent updates?
- Are **database constraints** (unique, not-null, FK) reflected in Java validations?
- Is **pagination** used for potentially large result sets, or is the whole table loaded?
- Could this change **corrupt existing data** or violate invariants in the DB?

### 2.5 API & Contract Review (if Controller/DTO present)
- Are HTTP status codes semantically correct? (200 vs 201 vs 204 vs 400 vs 409)
- Is input validated with `@Valid` / `@Validated`? Are constraint annotations present on DTOs?
- Is **error response format** consistent with the rest of the API?
- Are breaking changes introduced? (removed fields, changed types, renamed fields)
- Is sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) excluded from responses?

### 2.6 Error Handling & Resilience
- Are exceptions caught at the right level? Are they swallowed silently?
- Is there a `@ControllerAdvice` / `@RestControllerAdvice` and is this code consistent with it?
- Are external calls (HTTP, DB, queue) protected with **timeouts and fallbacks**?
- Could a failure here cause a **cascading failure** upstream?
- Are retries appropriate or could they cause **duplicate processing**?

### 2.7 Concurrency & Thread Safety
- Is shared mutable state accessed without synchronization?
- Are `HashMap`, `ArrayList`, or other non-thread-safe collections used in a shared context?
- Could a race condition occur between a read-then-write operation?
- Is `ThreadLocal` cleaned up properly?

### 2.8 Performance
- Are there obvious **N+1 queries** or missing `JOIN FETCH`?
- Are large objects serialized/deserialized unnecessarily?
- Are **indexes** likely needed for the query patterns implied?
- Is there unnecessary object creation in hot paths?

### 2.9 Code Quality & Maintainability
- Are method/variable names clear and intention-revealing?
- Is the method doing too many things (violates Single Responsibility)?
- Are magic numbers/strings present that should be constants or config?
- Is there dead code or commented-out code that shouldn't be there?
- Is logging adequate? (but not excessive — no logging of sensitive data)

## Phase 3 — Output Format

Structure your review in this exact format:

---

### 🔍 Code Review: `[ClassName or feature name]`

**Summary**
One paragraph: what this code does, what layer it's in, and your overall assessment (safe / needs minor fixes / has critical issues).

---

**🚨 Critical Issues** *(must fix before deploy)*
List each issue with:
- **Issue**: What is wrong
- **Location**: Method/line reference
- **Why it matters**: Business or technical impact
- **Fix**: Concrete suggestion or code snippet

---

**⚠️ Ripple Effect / Cross-System Risks**
For each risk:
- **What changed**: Description of the change
- **What may break**: Other code, APIs, consumers, DB, or integrations
- **Severity**: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
- **Recommendation**: What to verify or update elsewhere

---

**🟡 Warnings** *(should fix, not blocking)*
Bullet list of issues that are non-critical but important.

---

**💡 Suggestions** *(improvements, best practices)*
Bullet list of optional improvements.

---

**✅ What's done well**
Brief acknowledgment of good patterns seen.

## Phase 4 — Follow-up Behavior

After delivering the review:
- If the user shares **more files** (e.g., the caller service, entity, migration), re-run Phase 2 with the expanded context and update the ripple risk analysis.
- If the user says **"show me the fix"**, provide the corrected code with `// CHANGED:` comments.
- If the user asks **"will this break X"**, trace the call chain explicitly and give a confident YES/NO/MAYBE with reasoning.
- If reviewing a **PR diff** (only changed lines shown), explicitly note: *"I can only see the diff — if you share the full class I can give deeper analysis."*
- If you lack enough context to confidently assess a section, say so explicitly and list what additional files would improve the review.

## Example

**Input:**
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {

    @Autowired
    private OrderRepository orderRepo;

    public void cancelOrder(Long orderId) {
        Order order = orderRepo.findById(orderId).orElseThrow();
        order.setStatus("CANCELLED");
        orderRepo.save(order);
    }
}
```

**Expected output highlights:**
- 🚨 No `@Transactional` — if `save()` fails, the status change is inconsistent
- 🚨 No ownership check — any caller can cancel any order by ID (IDOR risk)
- ⚠️ Direct status set bypasses state machine — SHIPPED orders could be directly CANCELLED
- ⚠️ No inventory release on cancellation
- 💡 Use an enum for status instead of raw String
